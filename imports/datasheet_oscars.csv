95	2022	SciTech	SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL AWARD (Scientific and Engineering Award)			Larry Barton|Ben Wilcox	True		The CineTape distance measurement system provides focus-pullers with continuous, accurate, real-time distance information to the subject, either at the camera or remotely. This high resolution distance data has enabled the reliable execution of shots that previously were impossible to judge accurately or had required multiple takes to achieve.
95	2022	SciTech	SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL AWARD (Scientific and Engineering Award)			Howard Preston|Bernie Butler-Smith	True		The Light Ranger 2 provides precise real-time focus distance information by continuously tracking subjects in sixteen discrete zones. The distance and depth of field indicators are superimposed on the camera image, enabling the focus-puller to intuitively judge focus, even in formerly impossible and extremely challenging situations.
95	2022	SciTech	SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL AWARD (Technical Achievement Award)			Howard Jensen|Danny Cangemi|John Frazier	True		The Rain Bars provide a portable system for the creation of realistic, large-scale, adjustable, practical rain for motion pictures. Their rapid setup and relocation capabilities enable the efficient production of effects ranging from misting drizzles to torrential downpours.
95	2022	SciTech	SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL AWARD (Technical Achievement Award)			Mark Hills|Jim Vanns	True		FQ’s highly efficient scheduler and sophisticated prioritization algorithms reflect a deep understanding of render farm management. With an architecture that has remained largely unchanged for more than a decade, FQ continues to support substantial growth in computational complexity at Framestore.
95	2022	SciTech	SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL AWARD (Technical Achievement Award)			Matt Chambers	True		These design contributions have resulted in robust, versatile, extensible and highly scalable render farm management systems that have supported substantial growth in computational complexity at Sony Pictures Imageworks and Weta Digital.
95	2022	SciTech	SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL AWARD (Technical Achievement Award)			Sébastien Deguy|Christophe Soum|Sylvain Paris|Nicolas Wirrmann	True		Adobe Substance 3D Designer provides artists with a flexible and efficient procedural workflow for designing complex textures. Its sophisticated and art-directable pattern generators, intuitive design, and renderer-agnostic architecture have led to widespread adoption in motion picture visual effects and animation.
95	2022	SciTech	SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL AWARD (Technical Achievement Award)			David Eberle|Theodore Kim|Fernando De Goes|Audrey Wong	True		Fizt2 provides a high-performance solver with novel and stable implicit physics and robust collision detection. The design of this system enables artist workflows to easily apply soft-body dynamics to a broad range of interacting animated characters and objects.
